## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Overview
The **Attested Image-Editing Stack** is a Zero-Knowledge (ZK)-powered image provenance solution that tracks and verifies every modification made to an image. It ensures authenticity without exposing sensitive data and helps combat forgeries, deepfakes, and AI-generated forgeries.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
Manipulated and AI-generated images are eroding trust in digital content. Existing solutions either expose personal metadata or lack cryptographic verification. Our stack provides a privacy-preserving, tamper-proof way to verify image authenticity.

### 1.3 Key Benefits
- ‚úÖ **Privacy-Preserving** ‚Äì Uses succinct SP1 ZK proofs to verify authenticity without revealing unnecessary details.  
- ‚úÖ **Tamper-Proof** ‚Äì Hashes proofs on Celestia‚Äôs blockchain, with metadata stored on IPFS Pinata.  
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive AI Detection** ‚Äì Flags deepfakes, AI-generated images, and all possible image manipulations.  
- ‚úÖ **Seamless User & Developer Experience** ‚Äì Available as an npm library and browser extension.

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1 Edit Tracking & Cryptographic Proofs
- Every image edit (crop, filter, retouch) generates a cryptographic proof.  
- Proofs are hashed and stored on Celestia‚Äôs blockchain.  
- System checks if an image already has a proof before reprocessing verification.

### 2.2 ZK Verification for Authenticity
- Uses succinct SP1 zkVM to verify authenticity without exposing image details.  
- Generates a hash link to on-chain data, readable in the UI and verifiable on Celestia‚Äôs blockchain explorer.

### 2.3 AI-Powered Image Manipulation & Deepfake Detection
- Uses an AI image detection API provider to analyze images.  
- Identifies all possible tampering methods, including:  
  - ‚úÖ AI-generated images.  
  - ‚úÖ Deepfakes.  
  - ‚úÖ Edited or manipulated content.  
- System flags images as:  
  - ‚úÖ **Verified Authentic** ‚Äì Original, no major edits.  
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Modified with Proofs** ‚Äì Edit history available.  
  - ‚ùå **AI-Generated/Manipulated** ‚Äì Possible deepfake detected.

### 2.4 Tamper-Proof Storage (Hybrid On-Chain + Off-Chain)
- Metadata & Proofs stored on IPFS Pinata.  
- Hash of the proof stored on Celestia‚Äôs blockchain.  
- Option to retrieve proof history before running another verification.

### 2.5 Authentication & Onboarding via Privy
- Uses Privy for user authentication.  
- Allows wallet-based login and social sign-ins.  
- Supports account-based proof history tracking (optional).

### 2.6 Seamless Developer & User Integration
- **npm Library** ‚Äì Developers can integrate the verification stack into apps like Photoshop or Figma.  
- **Browser Extension** ‚Äì Enables instant verification of images on the web (e.g., news articles, social media).

## 4. User Flow [MVP Focus: ZK (SP1 succinct) Verification]

### 4.1 High-Level Steps
1. Upload Image ‚Üí 2. Check for Existing Proof ‚Üí 3. Generate ZK Proof ‚Üí 4. Run AI Tampering Detection ‚Üí 5. View Verification Status ‚Üí 6. Share Verified Proof

### 4.2 Step-by-Step Breakdown
1. **Upload Image**  
   - Users upload an image via the web dashboard or browser extension.  
   - System checks for file format & size limits.  

2. **Check for Existing Proof**  
   - System searches Celestia‚Äôs blockchain and IPFS Pinata for existing proofs.  
   - If found, retrieves edit history & verification status before processing further.  

3. **Generate ZK Proof**  
   - Extracts metadata (timestamp, device, geolocation).  
   - Runs SP1 ZKVM proof generation for authenticity.  

4. **AI-Powered Image Manipulation & Deepfake Detection**  
   - Calls AI detection API to flag:  
     - AI-generated images.  
     - Deepfakes.  
     - Other manipulations.  

5. **View Verification Status**  
   - Displays one of three verification results:  
     - ‚úÖ **Verified Authentic**  
     - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Modified with Proofs**  
     - ‚ùå **AI-Generated/Manipulated**  
   - Provides a detailed proof page with:  
     - Cryptographic proof hash.  
     - Edit history.  
     - "View on Celestia Explorer" link.  

6. **Share Verified Proof**  
   - Users can:

## 7. Open Questions & Future Considerations
- Should verification be tied to user accounts or fully anonymous?  
- Should we allow premium features (e.g., priority verification, advanced AI scans)?  
- Would a marketplace for verified images add value?  
- How do we optimize proof generation speed for large-scale adoption?
